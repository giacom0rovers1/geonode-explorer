Scripts for automated detection of the land-water boundary were used to separate land from water in annual image composites for the period 2007-2017. During this process, data points were generated for each part along the European shoreline. These points were then averaged by year and analysed for a decadal period. 
Visualising pan-European shoreline change means making choices, like defining a stable shoreline for example. A mean rate of 0.5 metre per year was chosen, though this rate depends on the landscape: granite cliffs for example shows less decadal dynamics compared to a sandy barrier island.
The spatial resolution of the method, depending on the pixel resolution of the individual satellite images which is about 10 metres, is still limiting. Validations of abovementioned method have shown that the method is less accurate in case of bluffs, cliffs and muddy coasts, and as such further validations will need to take place. EMODnet Geology hopes that by releasing the satellite-based dataset now, coastal experts and other end users will be able to discover and communicate possibilities and limitations of automated methods for the extraction of shoreline position and quantification of annual to decadal change. To help in this process, a companion map showing shoreline migration on the basis of field data and expert is made available, thereby facilitating a first-order comparison.",tno:coastal_migration_satellite_1250k_3m,

protection and recreation. It is constantly modified by wind, waves and tides, and impacted by human activity.
Hence, the decadal change of shorelines reflect natural processes as well as human influence, whether positive
or negative. Climatic-driven changes such as sea level rise, higher waves and changes in wind direction put
increasing pressure on many of Europe’s shorelines.
Knowing how, and at what rate, our coasts are changing is the first step to successfully managing them. The
new EMODnet Geology shoreline-migration map, released today, allows users to visualise pan-European coastal
behaviour for 2007-2017 at different spatial scales. A built-in search and zoom functionality allows online users
to distinguish areas of landward migration (erosion or submergence), stability, and seaward migration (accretion
or emergence). The underlying, downloadable satellite-based dataset offers additional information on annual
values and uncertainty.
With the new map, international policy makers can determine large-scale coastal vulnerability while national
and regional coastal managers are able to fill existing gaps in field-monitoring data and to identify potential
areas of rapid change. The map also provides the general public with a useful insight into one of Europe’s most
obvious climate-change effects. Most importantly, scientists may explain spatial patterns and provide feedback
on methodological advantages as well as shortcomings, thus helping to optimise the big-data methodology
used.",tno:coastal_migration_satellite,

<h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
<p>Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in techniques and systems for rainfall surveillance on regional scale, with increasingly stringent requirements in terms of the following: (i) accuracy of rainfall rate measurements, (ii) adequate density of sensors over the territory, (iii) spacetime continuity and completeness of data and (iv) capability to elaborate rainfall maps in near real time. The devices deployed to monitor the precipitation fields are traditionally networks of rain gauges distributed throughout the territory, along with weather radars and satellite remote sensors operating in the optical or infrared band, none of which, however, are suitable for full compliance to all of the requirements cited above. More recently, a different approach to rain rate estimation techniques has been proposed and investigated, based on the measurement of the attenuation induced by rain on signals of pre-existing radio networks either in terrestrial links, e.g., the backhaul<br />connections in cellular networks, or in satellite-to-earth links and, among the latter, notably those between geostationary broadcast satellites and domestic subscriber terminals in the Ku and Ka bands. Knowledge of the above rain-induced attenuation permits the retrieval of the corresponding rain intensity provided that a number of meteorological and geometric parameters are known and ultimately permits estimating the rain rate locally at the receiver site. In this survey paper, we specifically focus on such a type of &ldquo;opportunistic&rdquo; systems for rain field monitoring, which appear very promising in view of the wide diffusion over the territory of low-cost domestic terminals for the reception of satellite signals, prospectively allowing for a considerable geographical capillarity in the distribution of sensors, at least in more densely populated areas. The purpose of the paper is to present a broad albeit synthetic overview of the numerous issues inherent in the above rain monitoring approach, along with a number of solutions and algorithms proposed in the literature in recent years, and ultimately to provide an exhaustive account of the current state of the art. Initially, the main relevant aspects of the satellite link are reviewed, including those related to satellite dynamics, frequency bands, signal formats, propagation channel and radio link geometry, all of which have a role in rainfall rate estimation algorithms. We discuss the impact of all these factors on rain estimation accuracy while also highlighting the substantial differences inherent in this approach in comparison with traditional rain monitoring techniques. We also review the basic formulas relating rain rate intensity to a variation of the received signal level or of the signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive literature survey of the main research issues for the aforementioned scenario and provide a brief outline of the algorithms proposed for their solution, highlighting their points of strength and weakness. The paper includes an extensive list of bibliographic references from which the material presented herein was taken.</p>

<p>Coastal erosion is a natural phenomenon that is becoming a growing problem along coastlines around the world. In this research, the evolution of two beaches located in Benidorm (Spain) has been studied: Poniente Beach and Levante Beach. Both have similar characteristics, but present a different morphological behaviour. An analysis of shoreline evolution has been carried out using aerial images. Then, waves and incident storms were studied and, finally, a sedimentological analysis was performed. From the results obtained, the eastern zone of Poniente Beach presents higher rates of erosion than the western zone. This erosion trend disappeared in the last analysed period due to a change in the incoming wave regime. A decrease in the frequency of waves coming from the east caused the erosion and tilting suffered by this beach. In Levante Beach, the intensity of the waves was reduced, making erosion rates lower. Furthermore, important differences were found from the sedimentological study, such as the lack of homogeneity in sediment grain sizes and a worse wear behaviour on Poniente Beach compared to Levante Beach, which means that these two beaches behave differently facing erosion. This accurate knowledge of the factors mentioned will provide adequate tools for its future management.</p>

The town of Piran has roughly 3,800 inhabitants. The population of the entire municipality of Piran that extends into the hinterland is 18,500. Since it is located right next to Mediterranean Sea, the town is popular among tourists and many apartments are owned by non-permanent residents (from other parts of Slovenia or abroad) and the<br />town population substantially differs between off season in winter and high season in summer.<br />Piran, known as </span><span class=""fontstyle3"">&ldquo;the city of salt&rdquo;</span><span class=""fontstyle2"">, is a relatively small town with a rich cross-cultural history along the Adriatic coast. For more than 500 years Piran was part of the Republic of Venice, which is pronounced in the town&acute;s architecture. The city&rsquo;s coastal position in combination with its cultural heritage are the main attraction for tourism.</span></p>",,
