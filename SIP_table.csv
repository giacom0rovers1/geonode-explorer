Scripts for automated detection of the land-water boundary were used to separate land from water in annual image composites for the period 2007-2017. During this process, data points were generated for each part along the European shoreline. These points were then averaged by year and analysed for a decadal period. 
Visualising pan-European shoreline change means making choices, like defining a stable shoreline for example. A mean rate of 0.5 metre per year was chosen, though this rate depends on the landscape: granite cliffs for example shows less decadal dynamics compared to a sandy barrier island.
The spatial resolution of the method, depending on the pixel resolution of the individual satellite images which is about 10 metres, is still limiting. Validations of abovementioned method have shown that the method is less accurate in case of bluffs, cliffs and muddy coasts, and as such further validations will need to take place. EMODnet Geology hopes that by releasing the satellite-based dataset now, coastal experts and other end users will be able to discover and communicate possibilities and limitations of automated methods for the extraction of shoreline position and quantification of annual to decadal change. To help in this process, a companion map showing shoreline migration on the basis of field data and expert is made available, thereby facilitating a first-order comparison.",tno:coastal_migration_satellite_1250k_3m

The town of Piran has roughly 3,800 inhabitants. The population of the entire municipality of Piran that extends into the hinterland is 18,500. Since it is located right next to Mediterranean Sea, the town is popular among tourists and many apartments are owned by non-permanent residents (from other parts of Slovenia or abroad) and the<br />town population substantially differs between off season in winter and high season in summer.<br />Piran, known as </span><span class=""fontstyle3"">&ldquo;the city of salt&rdquo;</span><span class=""fontstyle2"">, is a relatively small town with a rich cross-cultural history along the Adriatic coast. For more than 500 years Piran was part of the Republic of Venice, which is pronounced in the town&acute;s architecture. The city&rsquo;s coastal position in combination with its cultural heritage are the main attraction for tourism.</span></p>",
